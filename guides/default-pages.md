# Using Default Pages

WP Shopify comes with two default pages: **"WP Shopify Products"** and **"WP Shopify Collections"**. These two pages are created when the plugin is first installed. The purpose of these pages is to display a list of your products or collections.

However, if you do not wish to use these pages you can turn them off within the plugin settings. You can also choose a different page to be used instead.

## Change default pages

If you would like to change the default pages, go into the plugin settings and open the General section. Once open, configure the `Default Products Page` and `Default Collections Page` options and click save settings toward the bottom.
