# Share plugin usage data

Choosing to share plugin usage data enables us to better understand exactly which plugin features are being used. This is tremendously helpful in making the plugin better.

Here are the important things to know when sharing your data:

1. This is completely opt-in. We will not track your plugin usage without explicit consent.
2. We will embed a Google Analytics snippet onto the plugin settings page. This snippet _only_ runs on the WP Shopify settings pages. It will not run on your posts, pages, or front-end.
3. We will only track clicks that are made to the plugin settings.
4. We will only track page views for each plugin settings tab.
5. We do not attach any personal information to the clicks or page views.

If you have any additional questions or concerns about our plugin usage tracking, please send us an email here: [hello@wpshop.io](hello@wpshop.io).
