# Share plugin usage data

Choosing to share plugin usage data enables us to better understand exactly which plugin features are being used. This is tremendously helpful in making the plugin better.

Here are the important things to know when sharing your data:

1. This is completely opt-in. We will not track your plugin usage without explicit consent.
2. We will embed a Google Analytics snippet onto the plugin settings page. This snippet _only_ runs on the WP Shopify settings pages. It will not run on your posts, pages, or front-end.
3. We will track the clicks you make on each plugin setting.
4. We do not attach any personal information to the clicks or tracking

If you have any additional questions or concerns about plugin usage tracking, send us an email here: [hello@wpshop.io](hello@wpshop.io).
