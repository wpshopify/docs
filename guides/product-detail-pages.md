# Creating Product Detail Pages

Product and Collection Detail Pages are turned off by default. So before you can use them, you'll need to go through a couple steps to turn them on.

## 1. Turn on Create Product Detail Pages

First, go into the plugin settings and open the General section. Once open, enable the `Create Product Detail Pages` option and click save settings toward the bottom.

## 2. Sync Product & Collection Detail Pages

The next step is to actually create the detail pages. You can do this by clicking the "Tools" tab at the top and using the `Sync Detail Pages` button.

## 3. Viewing the pages

Once the sync is finished, you should see a list of products within WordPress under WP Shopify - Products.
