# Upgrading to WP Shopify Pro

Welcome to our guide on upgrading to WP Shopify Pro! 👍

Before we get started, keep in mind that WP Shopify and WP Shopify Pro are separate, independent plugins. As a result, you should never have both activated at once. You'll want to either use one or the other. Also rest assured that the upgrade process will _not_ remove any content you may have added, including synced Shopify data, updated settings, etc.

### 1. Purchase a License Key

Before you can start using WP Shopify Pro you must first purchase a license key.

Once you've finished purchasing, sign in to your WP Shopify account and download the Pro plugin. You can find the download button under the "Downloads" tab.

You can also find a download link within the welcome email sent to you.

### 3. Deactivate the Free Version _ Important _

Before you install and activate the Pro version, open your WordPress dashboard and deactivate the free version. Make sure to do this before installing the Pro version or you may get errors.
