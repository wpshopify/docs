# 🏗️ WP Shopify 2.0 (beta)

<br>

Welcome to the WP Shopify 2.0 Beta!

> New docs site: https://docs.wpshop.io<br>
> New demo site: https://demo.wpshop.io

⚠️ Please read the below points carefully before you begin! ⚠️

-  WP Shopify `2.0` is _not_ fully backwards compatible with `1.x`. Therefore, we recommend that you install the beta on a clean WordPress site. Do not have a `1.x` version installed or activated while using `2.0`. Before 2.0 is released to the public, we'll be creating a detailed migration guide. The transition will be pretty easy.
-  _Only_ the new shortcodes and cart are working at the moment. This means the product single pages and product posts do _not_ work.
-  Once the beta is installed, you'll go through the syncing process like normal. The only difference (at the moment) are the shortcodes. See the demo site above for examples ☝️
-  There is now a useful demo site found here: https://demo.wpshop.io. Examples of how to use the new shortcodes can be seen. we'll be updating this as more beta features are released.
-  The `wps-templates` placed within your theme will not work at the moment
-  New updates will be released frequently. we'll be sending notifications inside this Slack channel when a beta update is released.
-  Bugs will exist 🐛. Please let us know if you find any!
-  Much of the documentation is still being written
-  You're awesome, thanks for testing! 🎉
