# 🏗️ WP Shopify 2.0 (beta)

<br>

Welcome to the WP Shopify 2.0 Beta! Things to note as you begin ...

-  WP Shopify `2.0` is _not_ fully backwards compatible with `1.x`. Therefore, we recommend that you install the beta on a clean WordPress site. Do not have a `1.x` version installed or activated while using `2.0`.
-  _Only_ the new shortcodes and cart are working at the moment. This means the product single pages, and the product posts do not work.
-  The "wps-templates" placed within your theme do not work at the moment
-  New updates will be released continuously. I'll be sending notifications inside our Slack channel when a beta update is released.
-  Bugs will exist 🐛. Please let me know if you find any!
-  Much of the documentation is still being written
-  You're awesome, thanks for testing! 🎉
