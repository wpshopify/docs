# Syncing

Syncing your Shopify store to WordPress is pretty straight forward. However it does require a little bit of configuration within Shopify beforehand. We've made a short video tutorial below that will walk you through the entire process. We've also listed the steps in long form below for convenience.

## Step 1.

Install WP Shopify and navigate to the "Connect" tab within the plugin Settings.

## Step 2.

In a new tab or window, open your Shopify store and click "Apps" within the left side nav.

## Step 3.

Next, click on the "Manage private apps" link towards the bottom of the new screen.

## Step 4.

Click "create a new private app"

## Step 5.

Next, fill in the "Private app name" field. This can be anything you want. We'll use "WP Shopify" so it's easy to distinguish itself from other apps.

## Step 6.

Make sure all Admin API permissions are set to "Read and write". The last permission, "Analytics", can be set to "Read access".

## Step 7.

Scroll to the bottom and ensure that the Storefront API box is checked and click "Save".

## Step 8.

You should now see a list of API credentials for your new private WP Shopify app.

## Step 9.

Next, go back to WordPress and begin filling in the API credentials from the Private App and click "Connect your Shopify store".

## Step 10.

The plugin should begin syncing your store data. Depending on how many products you have, the syncing process can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 10minutes.

## Step 11.

Once the syncing is finished you should see a "completed" message. You're now connected and syncing with Shopify!
