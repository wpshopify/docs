# License

WP Shopify comes in two versions: Free and Pro. If you want access to the features of the Pro version, you must purchase a license key first.

## Activating your license key

Once you have the license key, you will need activate it to receive plugin updates. You can do this by going to the plugin settings and clicking the "License" tab. From there, simply add your key and click "Activate License". If it works, you should see a green success notification.

If you're running into problems, please send us a message in Slack or shoot us an email.

## How license keys work with localhost

Activating a WP Shopify license within a development environment will not count towards your activation limit. A development environment will be recognized when using one of the following domains:

-  localhost
-  10.0.0.0/8
-  172.16.0.0/12
-  192.168.0.0/16
-  \*.dev
-  .\*local
-  dev.\_
-  staging.\_
-  staging-\*
