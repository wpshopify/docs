# WP Shopify Features

WP Shopify comes with many unique features. Below is a non-comprehensive list of the most popular features with a description of how they work. If you have questions please [email us](mailto:hello@wpshop.io)!

## Automatic syncing

The automatic syncing feature keeps your WordPress site "in sync" automatically with your Shopify store. For example, in Shopify if you change the title or price of a product, this change will automatically reflect itself on WordPress.

Starting in version `2.1`, caching was introduced to help speed up the plugin's page-load time. If you're not seeing your Shopify changes reflected on WordPress automatically, try clearing the plugin cache, reducing the cache time, or disabling the cache altogether.

This feature is in both plugin versions.

## Shortcodes

WP Shopify comes with various shortcodes. These shortcodes allow you to control how your products look, which products show, and many other properties. This gives you flexibility to customize products in ways that the plugin default pages do not.

For example, each shortcode has a wide variety of attributes which you can use to tweak different settings. Everything from filtering products by tags, custom sorting, hiding buttons or product descriptions, and even [infinite scrolling for Pro users](https://wpshop.io/purchase).

**Below is the full list of provided shortcodes:**

- [[wps_products]](shortcodes/wps_products)
- [[wps_products_title]](shortcodes/wps_products_title.md)
- [[wps_products_description]](shortcodes/wps_products_description.md)
- [[wps_products_pricing]](shortcodes/wps_products_pricing.md)
- [[wps_products_buy_button]](shortcodes/wps_products_buy_button.md)
- [[wps_products_gallery]](shortcodes/wps_products_gallery.md)
- [[wps_collections]](shortcodes/wps_collections.md)
- [[wps_cart_icon]](shortcodes/wps_cart_icon.md)
- [[wps_search]](shortcodes/wps_search.md) (pro only)
- [[wps_storefront]](shortcodes/wps_storefront.md) (pro only)

Shortcodes are in both plugin versions. The exceptions are [[wps_search]](shortcodes/wps_search.md) and [[wps_storefront]](shortcodes/wps_storefront.md) which are pro-only shortcodes.

## Built-in cart experience

WP Shopify comes with a built-in cart experience. The cart has a slide-out affect which you can see on [our demo page](http://demo.wpshop.io).

When the user is ready to pay and click "Checkout", they're taken to the default Shopify checkout page like normal.

Any Shopify third-party app which customizes the checkout page will work with WP Shopify.

This feature is in both plugin versions.

## No iframes

WP Shopify does not use iframes to display products and collections. Because we use raw HTML, you can use custom CSS to adjust the visual layout to your liking.

This feature is in both plugin versions.

## Product detail pages

WP Shopify will create product and collection detail pages for you. By default, these pages are disabled by the plugin. However you can turn them on by enabling "Sync posts" within the plugin settings followed by a manual resync of your Shopify store from the Tools tab.

You can see a live example on [our demo page](https://demo.wpshop.io/shop/products/test).

This feature is in both plugin versions.

## Fixed cart icon

Like all eCommerce sites, WP Shopify allows you to place a "cart icon" anywhere on your site. You can also enable a "fixed" icon that locks to the side of the page. This fixed cart icon follows the user as they scroll for easy of use.

You can see a live example on [our demo page](https://demo.wpshop.io).

This feature is in both plugin versions.
